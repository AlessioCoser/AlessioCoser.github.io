# About Me

I strive at continuously improving my knowledge, by studying practices, languages, methodologies and applying what I learn to my everyday work. I strongly believe in teamwork and in the fact that the team should be autonomous and responsible during the whole life-cycle of a product or a service, from its development to its release and to software maintenance.

I like getting to know approaches other than mine and being confronted with various programming languages and methodologies, in order to acquire a global perspective and to adopt the best solutions according to the context in which I am operating and to the problem I need to solve.

Since I have become an employee at XPeppers I have been using eXtreme Programming practices to reduce the feedback loop and simplify the continuous development of working software.
