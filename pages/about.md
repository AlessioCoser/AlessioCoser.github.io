I am a _software crafter_ and a passionate advocate of [eXtreme Programming](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/).
I aim to continuously learn better ways to deliver working software faster.

I have been lucky to have been part of several **cross-functional** teams adopting **eXtreme Programming**. These teams were quite **autonomous** and **responsible** for the [entire life cycle](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DevOpsCulture.html) of a product or service.

Through these experiences I have learned so much, and I still have a lot to learn.

Just to name a few things, I became aware of what **true teamwork** really means: continuous collaboration, sharing, review and feedback through [pair programming](https://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html#RemotePairing) retrospectives, common study or book clubs.

I discovered the effectiveness of [codebase quality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSes_PexXcA) to keep the cost of change constant over time by adopting some [core design principles](https://youtu.be/llGgO74uXMI) and practices such as **TDD/ATDD**, simple design, hexagonal architecture, [continuous integration](https://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html).

I realized that keeping things **simple is not easy** at all, both [on the codebase](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/8-lines-code-refactoring/) and in the business processes, but if you are able to keep things simple everyone will benefit from that with less stress, fewer context switches, more clarity and more focus.

I have experienced the **smoothness** of working in a focused team, **reducing the work in progress**, deciding [not to estimate](https://amzn.eu/d/0hdCgGk) and tackling one small activity at a time. **Activity that is sliced vertically based on business value**, from which feedback is gathered and used to improve it.
