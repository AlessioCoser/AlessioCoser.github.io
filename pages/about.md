I am a _software crafter_ and a passionate advocate of [eXtreme Programming](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/).
I aim to continuously learn better ways to deliver working software faster.

I have been lucky to have been part of several **cross-functional** teams adopting **eXtreme Programming**. These teams were quite **autonomous** and **responsible** for the entire life cycle of a product or service.

Through these experiences I have learned so much.

Just to name a few things, I became aware of what **true teamwork** really means: continuous collaboration, sharing, review and feedback through **pair programming**, retrospectives, common study or book clubs.

I discovered the effectiveness of **codebase quality** to keep the cost of change constant over time by adopting practices such as **TDD/ATDD**, simple design, hexagonal architecture, **continuous integration**.

I realized that keeping things **simple is not easy** at all, both on the codebase and in the business processes, but if you are able to keep things simple everyone will benefit from that with less stress, fewer context switches, more clarity and more focus.
